            {" "}
            I was born and raised in the vibrant and culturally rich city of
            Kathmandu, Nepal, surrounded by the majestic Himalayan mountains and
            a melting pot of diverse traditions. Growing up in this unique
            environment, I was exposed to a constant influx of tourists from
            around the globe, which sparked my curiosity and ignited my
            fascination with technology's transformative power. From an early
            age, I observed how technology had the ability to connect people,
            bridge gaps, and bring about positive change in society. I was
            captivated by the way it could enhance communication, improve
            efficiency, and open doors to endless possibilities. This
            realization kindled a deep-seated passion within me and ignited a
            desire to explore the field of technology, determined to make a
            difference in the lives of people in my community and beyond I made
            a bold decision to embark on a journey that seemed almost
            improbableâ€”an expedition to unleash the potential of technology and
            bring about transformation by exploring my carrier in Science and
            Technology and I moved to this great country America for bachelorâ€™s
            degree in computer science.
          </p>

          <p>
            As soon as I finished my Associate's degree in Information
            Technology at{" "}

              Community College of Baltimore County{" "}
            </a>{" "}
            , I made the decision to complete full-stack coding skills in order
            to advance my understanding of coding and web development and to
            begin my professional career in this sector. So, I enrolled inÂ {" "}

            So, I am very optimistic and thrilled to develop productive,
